## Summary

Software engineer specializing in frontend architecture for cross-platform enterprise applications. Transitioned from precision analog hardware design (Fluke Calibrators) to software engineering in 2022 after building test automation tools and calibration dashboards during hardware role, bringing systems-level thinking and design rigor to frontend architecture.

Leading frontend architecture for platform-agnostic systems enabling single-codebase deployment across web and mobile. Focus areas include domain plugin architectures for runtime customization, schema-driven renderers, and component libraries following accessibility-first principles. Work prioritizes maintainability, customer experience, and architectural patterns enabling domain experts to configure applications without code deployment.

Technical expertise: React, React Native, TypeScript, software architecture patterns, precision analog design, instrumentation, Python automation.
